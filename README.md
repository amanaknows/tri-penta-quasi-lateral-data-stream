Tri-Penta-Quasi-Lateral Datastream for AI Communication
Overview
The Tri-Penta-Quasi-Lateral Datastream for AI Communication is a secure and dynamic communication framework designed for AngelNET. This Python-based implementation provides a robust and scalable solution for handling multiple states and transmission types, ensuring secure and transparent communication between users and systems.

Features
Three States:

State 1: General Communication

State 2: Secure Communication

State 3: Internal AngelNET Institution Partners

Five Internal Communication Transmissions:

Transmission 1: Data Exchange

Transmission 2: Status Updates

Transmission 3: Alerts and Notifications

Transmission 4: Configuration Changes

Transmission 5: Logs and Reports

Security Features:

Encryption and checksum verification

Biometric authentication with deepfake detection

Multi-factor authentication (MFA)

Anomaly detection

Monitoring and reporting

Zero-knowledge proofs (zkSNARKs)

Google IAM integration

Dependencies
The project relies on the following dependencies:

Flask: A micro web framework for Python.
cryptography: A library for encryption and decryption.
hashlib: A library for generating and verifying checksums.
tempfile: A library for creating temporary files.
pyotp: A library for generating and verifying OTPs.
logging: A library for logging suspicious transactions.
scikit-learn: A library for anomaly detection.
numpy: A library for numerical operations.
py_ecc: A library for elliptic curve cryptography.
google-auth: A library for Google IAM integration.
deepface: A library for deepfake detection.
face_recognition: A library for facial recognition.
Installation
To install the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tri-penta-communication.git
   cd tri-penta-communication
Install the dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure the environment variables:
   cp .env.example .env
Update the values in the .env file accordingly.
Usage
The project provides the following functionality:

Communication Handling
/state//transmission/: Handles communication based on the state and transmission type.
Data Encryption and Checksum Verification
encrypt_data(data): Encrypts data using Fernet symmetric encryption.
decrypt_data(encrypted_data): Decrypts encrypted data.
generate_checksum(data): Generates a SHA-256 checksum for the given data.
verify_checksum(data, checksum): Verifies the SHA-256 checksum for the given data.
Biometric Authentication with Deepfake Detection
/biometric_auth: Endpoint for biometric authentication with deepfake detection using DeepFace.
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
/generate_otp: Endpoint for OTP generation using pyotp.
/verify_otp: Endpoint for OTP verification using pyotp.
Anomaly Detection
/anomaly_detection: Endpoint for detecting anomalies in user behavior using IsolationForest.
Monitoring and Reporting
/transaction: Endpoint for monitoring suspicious transactions.
Zero-Knowledge Proofs (zkSNARKs)
/zk_proof: Endpoint for generating zero-knowledge proofs.
/verify_zk_proof: Endpoint for verifying zero-knowledge proofs.
Google IAM Integration
/google_iam: Endpoint for Google IAM authentication.
Example Endpoint for Sending Data
/send_data: An example endpoint to send data to the appropriate state and transmission type.
Running the Application
Run the application:
   python tri_penta_communication.py
Use a tool like curl or Postman to test the endpoints. For example, to send data:
   curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"state": 1, "transmission": 1, "data": "Hello, World!"}' http://localhost:5000/send_data
Testing
Unit Testing
Run unit tests using unittest:

python test_tri_penta_communication.py
Integration Testing
Run integration tests using unittest:

python test_tri_penta_communication.py
Security Testing
Perform security testing using tools like OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite.

Performance Testing
Run performance tests using Locust:

locust -f locustfile.py
End-to-End Testing
Run end-to-end tests using Selenium:

python test_end_to_end.py
Mocking External Services
Use unittest.mock to mock external services in your tests.

Security
The project prioritizes security and transparency by utilizing the following measures:

Decentralized identity verification: AngelNET ensures the authenticity of user identities without relying on a central authority.
Zero-knowledge proof system: zkSNARKs enable the chatbot to verify user identities without revealing sensitive information.
Malicious intent detection: MalIntentDetector detects and prevents unauthorized access to sensitive information.
